# â˜• Chai aur JavaScript

This repository contains my notes, code snippets, and hands-on implementations from the **Chai aur JavaScript** YouTube playlist by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu71SKxNbfoBuX3f4EOACle2y-tRC5Q37).

The goal was not just to watch, but to **code along, experiment, break things, and learn deeply**. This repo reflects my journey through JavaScriptâ€”covering both foundational and advanced topics.

- Variables: `var`, `let`, `const`
